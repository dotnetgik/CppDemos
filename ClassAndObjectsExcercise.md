# Problem Statement 1 
Create a class named 'Student' with a string variable 'name' and an integer variable 'roll_no'. 
Assign the value of roll_no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student.

# Problem statement 2 

Write a program that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. 
The output should be as follows:
Name        Year of joining        Address
Sachin        1994             64C- Nagpur

Rahul        1999              26B- Mumbai



# Problem statement 3 

Print the average of three numbers entered by the user by creating 
a class named 'Average' having a function to calculate and print the average without creating any object of the Average class.
(Hint : Use static member function ) 


# Problem statement 4 

Write a C++ Program To Calculate Simple Interest using class

( Formula to calculate the intrest  is Amount * Rate* Duration ) 

# Problem statement 5 
Write a C++ Program To Calculate Electricity Bill Of Person using Class

Algorithm 
To Calculate Electricity Bill Of Person using Class,first we have to create and call  get( ) function to take input details of the customer.
After get( ) , we create and call a new function i.e  calc_bill( ) to calculate the total bill of the customer on the behalf of units consumed by the customer .
At last , we call the Display() function to print or display customer or person electricity bill on the screen.


# Problem statement 6

Create a class student with two propertie double gpa and int grade  (1,2,3,4,5 ) 
Default constructor will set both the values to 0 
Parameterized constructor will set these values to the constructors argument 
Write two Member functions getGPA() and getGrades() that will return the respective values

# Problem statement 7 
Create a Class Car that has two fields liters and conusumptions 
1. Default constructor will set those values to 50 and .5 respectively 
2. Parameterized constructor should set those values to the value passed to constructor 
Both these constructor should display the message that car has been created 
Write a destructor that will display message that given car has been destroyed 
Write a member function MaxDistanceCarCanTravel() which will return the distance car can travel can be calculated as liters/consumptions 
( Two data member defined in a class )
