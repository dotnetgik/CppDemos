#Excercise 1
Print multiplication table of 17, 37 and 115 using loop.
 output should be like this 
 17*1=17
 .
 .
 .
 .
 17*10=170
 
 
#Excercise 2
Take 5 integers from keyboard using loop and print their average value on the screen.

#Excercise 3 

Factorial of any number n is represented by n! and is equal to 1*2*3*....*(n-1)*n. E.g.-
4! = 1*2*3*4 = 24
3! = 3*2*1 = 6
2! = 2*1 = 2
Also,
1! = 1
0! = 0
Write a C++ program to calculate factorial of a number.

#Excercise 4

Write  program to find the sum of all integer between 100 and 750 which are divisible by 9.

#Excercise 5

Write a program to reverse a number 
Input

Input number: 12345
Output

Reverse of 12345 = 54321

#Logic to find the reverse is as follows 

Take number from user to find reverse. Store it in some variable.
Declare  variable to store reverse of num, say reverse = 0.
Extract last digit of the given number by performing modulo division and Store the last digit to some variable say 
lastDigit = num % 10.
Increase the place value of reverse by one. To increase place value multiply reverse variable by 10 i.e. reverse = reverse * 10.
Add lastDigit to reverse i.e. reverse = reverse + lastDigit.
Since last digit of num is processed hence, remove last digit of num. To remove last digit divide num by 10 i.e. num = num / 10.
Repeat step 3 to 6 till num is not equal to (or greater than) zero.
